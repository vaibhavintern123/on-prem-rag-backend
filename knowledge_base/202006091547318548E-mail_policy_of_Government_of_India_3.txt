1.1 The Government uses e-mail as a major mode of communication.
Communications include Government of India (GoI) data that travel
as part of mail transactions between users [1] located both within the
country and outside.
1.2 This policy of Government of India lays down the guidelines with
respect to use of e-mail services. The Implementing Agency (IA) [2]
for the GoI e-mail service shall be National Informatics Centre
(NIC), under the Department of Electronics and Information
Technology (DeitY), Ministry of Communications and Information
Technology. The organisations exempted under Clause 14 will
themselves become the Implementing Agency (IA) for the purpose
of this policy.
2. Scope
2.1 Only the e-mail services provided by NIC, the Implementing Agency
of the Government of India shall be used for official
communications by all organizations except those exempted under

5.1 Security
F. No. 2(22)/2013-EG-II
Ministry of Communication & Information Technology
Department of Electronics & Information Technology
Page 5 of 16
a) Considering the security concerns with regard to a sensitive
deployment like e-mail, apart from the service provided by the
IA, there would not be any other e-mail service under GoI.
b) All organizations, except those exempted under clause 14 of
this policy, should migrate their e-mail services to the
centralized deployment of the IA for security reasons and
uniform policy enforcement. For the purpose of continuity, the
e-mail address of the organization migrating their service to
the IA deployment shall be retained as part of the migration
process. Wherever it is technically feasible, data migration
shall also be done.
c) Secure access to the GoI email service
i) It is recommended for users working in sensitive offices
to use VPN[7]/OTP[8] for secure authentication as deemed
appropriate by the competent authority.
ii) It is recommended that GoI officials on long
deputation/stationed abroad and handling sensitive
information should use (VPN)/ (OTP) for accessing GoI email services as deemed appropriate by the competent
authority.
iii) It is recommended that Embassies and missions abroad
should use Static IP addresses for accessing the services
of the IA as deemed appropriate by the competent
authority.
iv) More information is available under “Guidelines for E-mail
Management and Effective E-mail Usage” at
http://www.deity.gov.in/content/policiesguidelines under
the caption “E-mail Policy”.
d) From the perspective of security, the following shall be
adhered to by all users of GoI e-mail service:
i) Relevant Policies framed by Ministry of Home Affairs,
relating to classification, handling and security of
information shall be followed.
F. No. 2(22)/2013-EG-II
Ministry of Communication & Information Technology
Department of Electronics & Information Technology
Page 6 of 16
ii) Use of Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) [6] and
encryption shall , be mandatory for sending e-mails
deemed as classified and sensitive, in accordance with
the relevant policies of Ministry of Home Affairs. Updation
of current mobile numbers under the personal profile of
users is mandatory for security reasons. The number
would be used only for alerts and information regarding
security sent by the IA. Updation of personal e-mail id
(preferably from a service provider within India), in
addition to the mobile number, shall also be mandatory in
order to reach the user through an alternate means for
sending alerts.
iii) Users shall not download e-mails from their official e-mail
account, configured on the GoI mail server, by configuring
POP [9] or IMAP [10] on any other e-mail service provider.
This implies that users should not provide their GoI e-mail
account details (id and password) to their accounts on
private e-mail service providers.
iv) Any e-mail addressed to a user, whose account has been
deactivated /deleted, shall not be redirected to another email address. Such e-mails may contain contents that
belong to the Government and hence no e-mails shall be
redirected.
v) The concerned nodal officer of the organization shall
ensure that the latest operating system, anti-virus and
application patches are available on all the devices, in
coordination with the User.
vi) In case a compromise of an e-mail id is detected by the
IA, an SMS alert shall be sent to the user on the
registered mobile number. In case an “attempt” to
compromise the password of an account is detected, an
e-mail alert shall be sent. Both the e-mail and the SMS
shall contain details of the action to be taken by the user.
In case a user does not take the required action even
F. No. 2(22)/2013-EG-II
Ministry of Communication & Information Technology
Department of Electronics & Information Technology
Page 7 of 16
after five such alerts (indicating a compromise), the IA
reserves the right to reset the password of that particular
e-mail id under intimation to the nodal officer of that
respective organization.
vii) In case of a situation when a compromise of a user id
impacts a large user base or the data security of the
deployment, the IA shall reset the password of that user
id. This action shall be taken on an immediate basis, and
the information shall be provided to the user and the nodal
officer subsequently. SMS shall be one of the prime
channels to contact a user; hence all users should ensure
that their mobile numbers are updated.
viii) Forwarding of e-mail from the e-mail id provided by GoI to
the Government official’s personal id outside the GoI email service is not allowed due to security reasons.
Official e-mail id provided by the IA can be used to
communicate with any other user, whether private or
public. However, the user must exercise due discretion on
the contents that are being sent as part of the e-mail.
ix) Auto-save of password in the Government e-mail service
shall not be permitted due to security reasons.
x) More details regarding security measures are available in

Ministry of Communication & Information Technology
Department of Electronics & Information Technology
Page 8 of 16
a) Based on the request of the respective organizations, IA will
create two ids, one based on the designation and the other
based on the name. Designation based id’s are recommended
for officers dealing with the public. Use of alphanumeric
characters as part of the e-mail id is recommended for
sensitive users as deemed appropriate by the competent
authority.
b) Government officers who resign or superannuate after
rendering at least 20 years of service shall be allowed to
retain the name based e-mail address i.e. userid@gov.in for
one year post resignation or superannuation. Subsequently, a
new e-mail address with the same user id but with a different
domain address (for instance, userid@pension.gov.in), would
be provided by the IA for their entire life.
More details pertaining to e-mail account management are
provided in “Guidelines for E-mail Account Management and
Effective E-mail Usage”” available at

10 IMAP IMAP is short for “The Internet Message Access
Protocol”, a protocol used to retrieve e-mail from a remote
mail server. Unlike POP, in IMAP, Messages are displayed
on your local computer but are kept and stored on the mail
server. IMAP allows you to sync your folders with the e-mail
server which is not possible using POP.

12 Phishing Phishing is a fraudulent attempt, usually made through email, to steal a user’s personal information. Phishing emails almost always tell a user to click a link that takes the
user to a site from where the personal information is
requested. Legitimate organisations would never request
this information via e-mail. Users should never click on a
link. A user should always type a URL in the browser even if
the link appears genuine.
13 Intranet An intranet is a private network that is contained within an
organization. For the purpose of this policy, computers
connected to an intranet are not allowed to connect to
internet.
